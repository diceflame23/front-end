This branch will house the lesson challenges from SkillCrush’s Front-end Developer Blueprint. Especially in earlier lesson challenges, the focus is abstraction or to “just get the functionality working”, and not UX. 

Unless otherwise noted, images, design, and lesson format were created by and belong to SkillCrush.    Check them out at https://skillcrush.com/.
